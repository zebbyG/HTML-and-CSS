<h1>My HTML notes</h1>
<P>This is a collection of notes from Udacity</P>
<h2>Introduction to the web and HTML.</h2>
<h3>The web</h3>
<p>
  Is a collection of files that are made using the HTML language. Also, <em>the web</em> can be defined as <em>HTML documents and other resources that refer to each other with links.</em>
  </p>
<p>
Web usually contain addresses <strong>http:</strong> or <strong>https:</strong> which stands for <em>HyperText Transfer Protocol.</em> This addresses are used to tell the server which rule/protocol to use.
</p>
<h3>HTML</h3> HTML stands for <mark>Hypertext Markup Language.</mark>
<p>
<em>Hypertext</em> are texts that can have references (such as links) to other documents and resources.
</p>
<em>Markup</em> Are texts that have a special meaning.
<div>
  These texts determine how a text in a web page looks like and how it's arranged.
<br> Also, <em>Markup</em> can have <strong>references</strong> to include other documents like videos e.t.c
</div>
<p>
HTML is the <strong>main language</strong> used to write <strong>web pages.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Web Pages and Servers</h2>
<p>
<strong>-</strong> A browser gets <em>web pages</em> by communicating with the <em>servers</em> over the internet.<br><strong> - Servers</strong> are computers that have running programs that give the browser its requests.
</p>
<h2>HTML and programming</h2>
<p>
When programming using the HTML language, there are some concepts that should be followed:<br>
<ol>
    <strong>
     <li>Syntax</li>
    </strong>
These are grammar rules of a computer language.
   <strong>
    <li>Formalism </li>
   </strong>
Computer do exactly what they are told to do. They <em>do not</em> correct any typos.
    <strong>
<li><strong>Nesting </strong></li>
</strong>
This is the idea of bits of code going inside other bits of codes.
</ol>
<h2>Text Editors and Files</h2>
<p>
<strong>Text files</strong> contain:<br>
  <ul>
      <li>letters</li>
      <li>Numbers</li>
      <li>symbols</li>
      <li>spaces</li>
  </ul>
<p>
The layout of a <strong>web page</strong> is determined by the code in the text file
</p>
<h2>Markup</h2>
<div>
Every <strong>element</strong> starts and ends with a tag.<br>The first tag  is known as the <strong><em>opening tag,</em></strong> and the one with a slash  is called a <strong><em>closing tag.</em></strong>
</div>
<p>
HTML tags always start with the <strong>(<)</strong> sign and end with a <strong>(>) </strong>tag. These tags are knowns as <em>angle brackets</em>.
</p>
<p>
The <em id="zebynjau">words</em> in between the <em id="ebbynjau">tags</em>, and the <em id="zbbynjau">tags</em> themselves is known as <strong>element.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Examples of tags are:<br>
  <ul>
      <strong>
          <li>em</li>
      </strong>
Which means emphasize. It brings out words in italics.
      <strong>
          <li>br</li>
      </strong>
Which means break. Is a tag used to create a line break/skips to the next line. It is a <em class="njau">void tag</em> meaning it does not allow any closing tag.
     <strong>
         <li>strong</li>
      </strong>
Used to make the words bold.
      <strong>
        <li>h1</li>
     </strong>
It is a header tag used to write headers and runs from <em class="njau">h1</em> (largest) to <em class="njau">h6</em> (smallest). <strong>h1</strong> is used for the main heading page, while the rest are used for sub-headings. Moreover, if the section comes after the other, we use the same level of heading.
     <strong>
       <li>mark</li>
     </strong>
Is used to highlight words.
     <strong>
         <li>p</li>
      </strong>
Which means <em class="njau">paragraph</em>. It separates a piece of text from other texts around it.
     <strong>
         <li>sub</li>
     </strong>
Meaning <em class="njau">subscript, </em> Is a tag used to position the words slightly below the other words.
     <strong>
       <li>sup</li>
     </strong>
Meaning <em class="njau">superscript</em>, Is a tag that places the words slightly above others.
  </ul>
<h2>Nested Elements</h2>
<p>
Elements on HTML can go inside other elements following a certain protocol. This means that the some elements must come before other elements when used together.
</p>
<div>
The top level elements always comes first, e.g, the paragraph elements and other big divisions. Inside these, there are other small division elements like the <em>em </em>elements.
</div>
<p>
These small division elements can also go inside other small division elements. For instance the <em>mark element</em> can go inside an <em>em</em> element and so on.
</p>
<h2>Block and Inline</h2>
<p>
Elements might be either <em>block</em> or <em>inline</em>
</p>
<h3>Block elements</h3>
<p>
As the name suggests, block elements are elements that adds a <em>block/invisible</em> box in between texts.
<div>
  Block elements are used for large sections of text, such as paragraphs, headlines, or lists; and also for some other features such as video players and tables.
  </div>
<div>
  Examples of block elements are:
  </div>
  <ul>
     <li><em><mark>h1</mark></em></li>
     <li><em><mark>p</mark></em></li>
     <li><em><mark>div</mark></em></li>
  </ul>
  and many more.
<h4>The<mark> div</mark> element</h4>
<p>
The <strong>div</strong> is a short for <strong><em>division</em></strong>. It is used to <em>divide</em> up the page into different sections.
</p>
<p>
It also has an invisible box around it which can also have a margin, a width, a height just like the (p) element.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the (p) element, the (div) element is a <strong><em>generic container</em></strong> for whatever other elements that might be put inside.
</p>
<p>
It is mainly used to <em>organize the content</em> and <em>divide the page</em> into sections.
</p>
<h3>Inline elements</h3>
<p>
These are the opposite of the block elements. They <strong>do not</strong> create blocks.<br>Some of the examples are:<br>
   <ul>
       <li><em><mark>br</mark></em></li>
       <li><em><mark>em</mark></em></li>
       <li><em><mark>mark</mark></em></li>
       <li><em><mark>strong</mark></em></li>
    </ul>
    and many more.
<h2>Lists and implied close tags</h2>
<p>
There are few HTML elements that are always used inside certain other elements, they are invalid on their own.<br>An example is the <strong>(li)</strong> element which is always nested in the <strong>(ol)</strong> tags or the <strong>(ul)</strong> tag.
</p>
<h3>The <em>ul</em> element</h3>
<p>
<em>ul</em> is an element used in listing items.<br><em>ul</em> which means unordered lists, lists out items in the browser with a <strong><em>dot</em> (.)</strong> before the name of the items.
</p>
<h3>The <em>ol</em> element</h3>
<p>
The <em>ol</em> element meaning <em>odered lists</em> is an element that displays items that are numbered unlike the <em>ul</em> elements that displays in dots.
</p>
<p>
    <div class="zebbylionnjau">
    <strong>
      NOTE:<em>The (ol) and the (ul) elements closing tags are necessary and are is a MUST for them to be there.<br>The (li) element closing tags are not necessary.<br>The (p) elements closing tag is not necessary too.</em>
    </strong>
</div>
<p>
  There are elements that closing tags are optional others are compulsory.
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Elements with optional closing tag.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>p</em></strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>li</em></strong></li>
      </ul>
      <li>Elements with compulsory closing tags.</li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><em>ol</em></strong></li>
        <li><strong><em>ul</em></strong></li>
      </ul>
  </ol>
<h2>Web Addresses</h2>
<p>
  In the web standards, there are tecnical terms for these addresses.
</p>
<p>
  A web addres is called a <strong>Uniform Resource Locater<em>(URL)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>UNIFORM</strong> = <em>standerdized/consitent</em></li>
    <li><strong>RESOURCE</strong> = <em>a file or other data object</em></li>
    <li><strong>LOCATOR</strong> = <em>address for finding something</em></li>
  </ul>
<p>
  The
  <strong>
    <em>URL</em>
  </strong>
  is an address that tells the browser how to locate a certain resource like a file in a standerdized way.
</p>
<p>
  There are different types of URL<em>s</em>, sometime they have the <strong><em>http/https</em></strong> some have the <strong><em>www.</em></strong>
</p>
<h3>Absolute URL<em>s</em></h3>
<p>
  Also known as a fully qualified URL.
  <strong>
    <em>(https://www.example.com)</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  There are alot that can appear on <em>URL</em>s. For instance,
  <ol>
    <li><mark>https</mark>://<em>en.wikipedia.org</em>/</li>
    <li><mark>file</mark>:/<em>//users/kelly/notes.html</em></li>
  </ol>
<p>
  The <strong><em>https</em></strong> simply tells the browser to use the secure encryption. In other cases it might be <strong><em>http</em></strong> which uses an insecure encryption to a web server.
</p>
<p>
  The second URL is a URL for a file that is in the local computer. It starts with a <strong><em>file</em></strong> instead of the <em>http/https</em>.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>https,http</em> and <em>file</em> are all protocols or ways that a browser can access something.
</p>
<p>
  After the protocol, the <strong>:</strong> and the double <strong>//</strong> separates the protocol  from the other part which is the <em>domain name.</em><br><strong>Domain name</strong> this tells the browser what server to connect to.
</p>
<p>
  But the file URLs don't have the <em>domain name</em> because there is no server its just a file from your computer.
</p>
<p>
  After the domain name the last thing that appers in a full URL is a file path, the name of the directory and the file the URL is referring to.<br>Sometimes it might be empty or a single slash if you are referring to the top page of a site.
</p>
<h2>Links and the Tag</h2>
<p>
 The element for making links is called the <strong><mark>a</mark></strong>
 <br>The <strong>a</strong> stands for <em>anchor.</em>
 <br>The element <em>anchors</em> an address to a piece of text on the page.
 <br>For a complete link to be created, the element is used with a couple things:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>The text that a user clicks on to follow to the link.</li>
  <li>The URL of the page you are linking to.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The opening tag of the link element has a little extra bit in it unlike other HTML tags.
  <br><mark>href</mark>="<strong><em>URL part</em></strong>."<strong>></strong>
  <br>The <em>URL part</em> is where you paste the link to the site you are linking to.
  <br>The <em>href</em> and the <em>URL part</em> they are called <strong><em>Attribute.</em></strong>
  <br>The <em>href</em> is the name of the attribute.
  <br>The <em>URL part</em> which is always in <mark>double quotes</mark> is the value of the attribute.
  <br><mark>href</mark> stands for <mark>h</mark>ypertext <mark>ref</mark>erence and its used with the <strong>(a)</strong> tag and afew other that link to other documents.
  <br><em>href</em> only go in the openning tag at the beginning of an element.
  <br>After the <strong>(>)</strong> sign, is the link text which becomes the text that appears on the page.
  <br>Then is the closing tag.
  <strong><em>The <strong>(a)</strong> element is an <mark>inline element.</mark></em></strong>
</p>
<h6>A.O.B</h6>
<p>
    <div>
  <a  href="https://github.com/zebbyG?tab=repositories">
      <img class="zebby" src="github.jpg" alt="Zebby">
    <em>Click picture for Author's github account</em>.
  </a>
    </div>
<h2>Adding Images</h2>
<p>
  The element for adding pictures in web browsers is the <strong>img</strong> tag. It works more like the link elements with some important differences.
  <br>Unlike the link element that has one attribute(<em>href</em>), the <strong><em>img</em></strong> uses two attributes:
  <ol>
    <li><mark>src</mark></li>
   This means <em>source</em> and is the URL of th image you want to appear in your webpage.
   <li><mark>alt</mark></li>
    Stands for <em>alternate</em> and its the text description of the image.
  </ol>
  <br>They both MUST be used when writing HTML.
<h3>The <mark>src</mark> attribute</h3>
<p>
  The <em>src</em> attribute tells the browser where to get the image from.
  <br>The source of the image.
</p>
<h3>The <mark>alt</mark> element</h3>
<p>
This is the text that appears incase the image wasn't found in the <strong>source (src)</strong> or if it cannot display the image.
</p>
<div class="zebbylionnjau">
  <strong>NB:</strong><em>Putting an</em> img <em>element in the HTML file doesn't copy the image, it tells the browser where to find that image file</em>(source)<em> and display it.</em>
  <em>The source might be your local disk or on a server</em>.
  <em>The <strong>img</strong> element is a void element</em>.
  <em>It is an inline element</em>.
</div>
<h2>Documents: The DOCTYPE Tag</h2>
<p>
  It is used to indicate what type of HTML is being used.
  <br>Unlike the other tags, it is written differently.
  <br>It is put at the top of every HTML document written.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>doctype tag</em> tells the browser how to treat a HTML document(<strong>modern HTML</strong>) in this case.
  <br>It  prevents bugs in complex HTMLs.
  <br>Without this tag browsers will go into <strong><em>quirks mode</em></strong> which is <em>trying to be more compatible with older forms of HTML</em>.
</p>
<h3>Documents: Head and Body</h3>
<h4>The Head</h4>
<div>
 The <em>head</em> is where we put certain pieces of important information about the document.
 The <em>title</em> is the only required part of the head.
 <br>It tells the browser what title to put on a tab that displays the document.
 The title is written inside openning and closing tags of the title element.
</div>
<div>
  The <em>style sheets</em> also appear in the head. This tells the browser what fonts and colors to display in the browser and how to position the text.
<br>The head can also contain <strong><em>scripts</em></strong> which are <em>programs that run in the browser</em>.
  This is used in <em>front-end</em> web apps.
</div>
<p>
  It also contains <strong><em>metadata</em></strong> which is <em>the other information about the page</em>, e.g, keywords for search engines.
  <br>The HTML tag can be added some characters which is the language your document is written in.(<em>human language</em>).
</p>
<h4>The Body</h4>
<p>
  This where the contents go, the paragraphs, images and all of that.
</p>
<h5>cascading style sheets links</h5>
